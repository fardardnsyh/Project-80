Extract Meaningful user intents and questions:\n  - Identify the question what the user itentionally asked, focusing on the the critial information about user's main concerns\/questions\/problems\/use cases, etc.\n  - Make this question simple and clear and ensure that it is directly related to the user's main concerns. Simple and clear question can improve the search accuracy.\n2. Establish Relationships to describe the user's intents:\n  - Define relationships that accurately represent the user's query intent and information needs.\n  - Format each relationship as: (Source Entity) - [Relationship] -> (Target Entity), where the relationship describes what the user wants to know about the connection between these entities.\n\n## Instructions:\n\n- Limit to no more than 3 pairs. These pairs must accurately reflect the user's real (sub)questions.\n- Ensure that the extracted pairs are of high quality and do not introduce unnecessary search elements.\n- Ensure that the relationships and intents are grounded and factual, based on the information provided in the query.",
