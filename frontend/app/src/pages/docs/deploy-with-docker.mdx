# Quick Start

This document provides instructions for deploying the entire RAG using Docker Compose.

## Deploy

> **Prerequisites:**
>
> 1. Set up a [TiDB Serverless cluster](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/tidb-cloud-quickstart).
> 2. Install [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/pingcap/tidb.ai.git
    cd tidb.ai
    ```

2. Copy and edit the `.env` file:

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    vim .env # or use another text editor to edit this file
    ```

    Replace the following placeholders with your own values:
    - `SECRET_KEY`: you can generate a random secret key using `python3 -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"`
    - `TIDB_HOST`, `TIDB_USER`, `TIDB_PASSWORD` and `TIDB_DATABASE`: get them from your [TiDB Serverless cluster](https://tidbcloud.com/)

      - Note: TiDB Serverless will provide a default database name called `test`, if you want to use another database name, you need to create a new database in the TiDB Serverless console.

3. Migrate the database schema:

    ```bash
    docker compose run backend /bin/sh -c "alembic upgrade head"
    ```

4. Bootstrap the database with initial data:

    ```bash
    docker compose run backend /bin/sh -c "python bootstrap.py"
    ```

    Running the bootstrap script creates an admin user. You can find the username and password in the output.

5. Start the services:

    ```bash
    docker compose up
    ```

6. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to access the web interface.

That's it! You can now use TiDB.AI locally. You can also go to https://tidb.ai to experience the live demo.


## Configuration

After you deploy the tool, you need to initialize the tool by following the popup wizard. The wizard will guide you through the following steps:

* Set up the default LLM model.
* Set up the default Embedding model.
* Set up `Data Source` to index the data.
